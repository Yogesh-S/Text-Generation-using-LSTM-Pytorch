# Text-Generation-using-LSTM-Pytorch

In this notebook, We'll construct a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network will train character by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example, we will train on Anna Karenina. **This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book!**<br /><br />
